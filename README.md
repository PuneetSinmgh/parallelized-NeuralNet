# variable_precision_deep_learning
Datasets are zipped in the MNIST_datasets file. Datasets are Images stored in the form of pixel values in csv file. Training dataset contains 60000 images and testing dataset contains 10000 images.  
The source code is in MNIST_Binary.cpp. Using the make command, code compiles and executable file as MNIST_Binary is produced. By running the executable, the model trains and tests on datasets.
Other details about input, output and results are mentioned in the design document.
